This means that no present success in obtaining what he needs for survival can reassure him.This is why Hobbes puts \"for a generall inclina- tion of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of Power after power, that ceaseth only in Death. \"Each appears to the other as a threat, and because each appears as a threat, each is a threat.Each of us is a potential threat to everyone else because each of us faces a world in which other people may cause us harm.The reasons for this are threefold:the state of nature is a state of scarcityHumans are diffident.Humans are prideful.these first two reasons for conflict can be dealt with fairly easily.Competition can be dealt with by the achievement of prosperitySimilarly, once there is a system of police, fear makes for peace rather than conflict.The third cause of conflict is not so easily dealt with.Hobbes insists that a peculiarity of human desire is its indeterminacy.one crude test of the value of our desires is the envy of other men.Hence, our desires are only satiable when we come to the top of the heap, and the criterion of success is universal envy. However,vainglory cannot be slaked by prosperity, and it creates a competition that security cannot defuse.The combined pressure of competition, diffidence, and glory leads to the war of all against all, and to a life that is poor, solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.To escape this condition, men must devise insti- tutions that will enforce rules of conduct that ensure peace.To discover what those rules are is to discover the law of nature.",

He is entitled to kill us if he wishes; we are in a state of nature with respect to him; we are, to use Hobbes's terminology, an enemy.This does not mean someone ac- tually engaged in fighting him, but someone who is not pledged not to fight him.The victor has the right of nature to do whatever seems good to him to secure himself, and killing us to be on the safe side is no injustice to us.Such a victor may offer us our lvies on the condition that we submit to his authority.Hobbes insists is that if we submit, we are bound. To cite the fact that we submitted out of fear is useless, because we always submit to authority out of fear.The only thing that can void a contract is an event subse- quent to the contract that makes it too dangerous to fulfil itNoth- ing that we could take into account when we made the contract counts against its validity.",
