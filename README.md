# genei-notepad-google-docs-exporter (GNGDE)
GNGDE is a python script for â€˜smartlyâ€™ exporting Genei notepads to Google Docs. It uses [OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 autoregressive language model](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) to summarise, punctuate, and format Genei notepad content and create a Google Doc based on its output. 

## GNGDE solves two problems with Genei notepads
Notes become messy and disorganised when adding highlighted text and summaries to a Genei notepad. They quickly become full of lousy punctuation, grammatical errors, and inconsistent formatting. Fixing these problems is time-consuming and tedious. GNGDE solves this problem by using GPT-3 to process notepad content and fix its formatting, punctuation, and grammar. GPT-3 can also summarise Genei notepads, distilling extended highlights from PDFs or lengthy summaries. 

A further problem with Genei notepads is that they currently do not have any GSuite export options. GNGDE performs this task by writing GPT-3 processed content to Google Docs. 

# Setup
## Packages
GNGDE uses the packages outlined in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install these packages on your local machine.

## OpenAI API
GNGDE requires an OpenAI API key which can be accessed [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). Paste your API key into the `API_Key` field in the [openai_credentials.json](openai_credentials.json) file.

## Google Docs API
GNGDE uses the [Google Docs API](https://developers.google.com/docs/api). Google Docs API credentials can be generated via the following steps. 
1. Create a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. [Enable the Google Docs API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/docs.googleapis.com) for your project from the Google Cloud Console. 
3. Create credentials for the Google Docs API:
    - Visit the Enabled APIs and services tab in the Google Cloud Console, select the Google Docs API, and click the Create Credentials button. 
    - GNGDE requires access to user data, so choose this option when choosing a credential type. 
    - Fill in the OAuth consent screen page using the app name genei-notepad-google-docs-exporter. 
    - Use your email for the user support email and developer contact information fields. 
    - Enable the ./auth/documents scope for the OAuth credential so GNGDE can create and edit Google Docs. 
    - Select â€˜Desktop appâ€™ as the application type for the OAuth Client ID and give the OAuth 2.0 Client a name. 
4. After creating an OAuth 2.0 Client, visit the Credentials tab in the Google Cloud Console and download the OAuth credentials as a .JSON file. Copy and paste the credentials from this file into GNGDEâ€™s [google_docs_credentials.json](google_docs_credentials.json) file. The file should look like this:
`{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": ***,
    "project_id": ***,
    "auth_uri": ***,
    "token_uri": ***,
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": ***,
    "client_secret": ***,
    "redirect_uris": [***]
  }
}`
5. To ensure you have access to GNGDE, visit the OAuth consent screen tab in the Google Cloud Console and add your email as a test user under the Test users section. 

# Usage
## Retrieving content from the Genei notepad
1. Using a browser like Chrome, right-click on a Genei notepad to inspect its elements and find the div with the ID `genei-editor-container`. 
2. Copy all of this divâ€™s child elements. This can be done in Chrome by right-clicking on the div, selecting â€˜Edit as HTMLâ€™ and copying all the editable content. 
3. Paste this HTML into GNGDEâ€™s [genei_notepad.html](genei_notepad.html) file. 

## Running GNGDE
1. Run the [export_genei_notepad.py](export_genei_notepad.py) file in GNGDEâ€™s export_genei_notepad directory.
2. When first running the [export_genei_notepad.py](export_genei_notepad.py) file, the Google Docs API will ask for GNGDE to be authorised. Follow Googleâ€™s authentication flow to authorise the app. 
3. Visit your Google Drive to view your â€˜smartâ€™ Genei notepad export as a Google Doc!

## Fine-tuning
- GPT-3 can process Genei notepad content in various ways by changing the `text_prompt` variable in the `process_text_snippet_with_openai` function in the [export_genei_notepad.py](export_genei_notepad.py) file. By default, this prompt is set to â€˜Turn these sentences into bullet points: â€™ but can be changed according to how you would like the model to process your notepad. 
- GPT-3â€™s response can also be tuned by editing the `temperature`, `frequency_penalty`, and `presence_penalty` fields in the `openai.Completion.create()` method called by the `make_openai_request` function in the [export_genei_notepad.py](export_genei_notepad.py) file. 
- GNGDEâ€™s Google Docs formatting can be edited by changing the `requests` arrays in the `create_title`, `create_bold_header`, `create_header`, `create_bold_sub_header`, and `create_text_with_bullet_points` functions in the [google_docs_formatting_helpers.py](google_docs_formatting_helpers.py) file.
