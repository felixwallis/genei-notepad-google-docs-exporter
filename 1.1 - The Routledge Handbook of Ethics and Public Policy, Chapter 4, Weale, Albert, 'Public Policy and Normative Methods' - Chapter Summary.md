# Introduction

- Few issues of public policy are exempt from potential ethical appraisal.
Seemingly technical sectors of policy involve questions of social responsibility.
Ethical considerations are always latent in any public policy.

# Normative reasoning in policy

It is common to make a sharp distinction between the empirical study of how public policies are made and the normative study of how those policies may be justified and evaluated.
Explaining why a policy was adopted is logically distinct from justifying or evaluating it.
However, a rigid distinction between the empirical and the normative disguises the extent to which policymaking is a matter of ‘evidence, argument and persuasion in the policy process' 

.
Understanding how policies are made requires essential reference to the arguments used by policy actors. 
Policy actors advocate policy positions in coalition with others who share a similar policy position.
They face competing coalitions advocating opposing arguments and policy choices.
Often the competition of ideas relates solely to the comparative efficiency of different policy instruments 

However, on many occasions, policy advocacy engages the ‘deep normative core’ 

For example 

Questions about the appropriate balance between markets and administrative regulation draw upon ideas of personal freedom and responsibility.
Public policy advocacy is a form of a contest among ideas joined together in webs of belief linking goals, instruments, and conceptions of social and political order. 

Policy choice also involves partisan contest by political parties and social movements.
Ideologies link value commitments to empirical claims.
Policy paradigms also draw upon or implicitly make use of certain philosophical assumptions.
For example, over many years, UK pollution control policy was implicitly utilitarian, based on the principle that the benefits of pollution control should be balanced against their costs, with the task of the pollution regulator being to promote the overall well-being of soci- ety. 

Precepts from the utilitarian philosophical tradition were thereby embedded in practical decision processes until they came under the challenge of principles that stressed precaution and the protection of citizens from the hazards of a risk society (Owens, 2015). 

Empirical policy studies thus underscore the view that the policy process is a contest of ideas, arguments, and principles. 

The making of public policy is not simply a matter of the pulling and hauling of mechanical forces; it is also a matter of advocacy and persuasion, as proponents of different points of view engage in argument and counter-argument over the right course of public action. 

Public policy-making is a matter of practical public reasoning.
From this characterisation 

one important methodological implication follows. 

If the policy process is the site of practical reasoning, then the techniques and meth- ods used to understand policy arguments from a normative point of view are also required to understand policy arguments from an empirical point of view. 

An important skill in this context is that of logical reconstruction. 

Within the decision- making process, policy arguments are typically stated in a piecemeal way, often making many taken-for-granted assumptions rather than stating fully articulated chains of reasoning. 

Logi- cally speaking, the policy texts are usually made up of enthymemes: incomplete fragments of argument rather than a fully articulated chain of reasoning linking premises to conclusion. 

The theoretical task is to recover and reconstruct the full chains of reasoning suggested by those enthymemes. 

The relevant methods involve the identification of key principles and values and the delineation of the logical patterns by which key ideas related to one another. 

When studying policy-making, political scientists typically take up a third-person perspective.
They are concerned to identify which principles and ways of think- ing influence policy developments over time or which body of ideas shapes cross-national variations in policy preferences and choices. 

In contrast, normative political theorists typically adopt a first-person plural perspective.
They ask 
‘which principles and values should we adopt in relation to a policy prob- lem?’ 

Policy-makers differ from one another in the way in which they relate decision premises to conclusions.
From a policy-maker’s point of view, political and policy agreement often requires those holding different and incompatible premises to share a common policy conclusion. 

Normative political theorists take the opposite point of view.
Because their focus is on the premises of practice policy reasoning, they distinguish among the different types of reasons that will lead to the same conclusion. 

Policy-makers welcome consensus on action despite differences of prem- ises, principles, and values; political theorists seek to distinguish premises, principles, and values despite consensus on action. 


# Conceptual analysis

Within the deep normative core of policy discussion and advocacy, concepts like freedom, rights, equality, and democracy are frequently used. 

However, the way in which core values are introduced into policy discussions is often ambiguous.
An important analytical task is to remove this ambiguity because the practical import of policy principles depends upon the meaning of those. 

When claims are ambiguous, rather than just meaningless, a useful technique is to distinguish between concepts on the one hand and conceptions on the other. 

A concept is the core idea that gives a basic meaning to a term, whereas a conception is one of the different forms that the core idea can take. 

Competing conceptions of key policy-related ideas thus define competing ideological positions in policy debates. 

Conceptual clarification is sometimes thought to be a minor task, confining the political theorist to the role of under-labourer.
However, this charge neglects the importance of con- ceptual analysis as the inevitable preliminary to further work. 

understanding the logical structure of a concept and specifying the different conceptions associated with that logical structure connect to differences in broader orientations in policy advocacy. 

When partisans are using different conceptions of key ideas, the crucial debate is not conceptual (what ‘the freedom to work’ really means) but substantive: under what conditions does productive activity take place and what are the implications of having one set of conditions in place rather than another set. 

Policy rhetoric is replaced by careful policy analysis 


# Policy argument and practical reasoning

Normative concepts are the elementary particles of practical public reasoning, identifying and distinguishing the different positions that policy advocates take. 

However, normative analysis is also needed to understand the different ways in which these elementary particles are bound together, and linked to broader assumptions about the role of government in society. 

Key nor- mative concepts in policy advocacy are embedded within broader patterns of argument. These patterns of argument replicate forms of argument found in different normative theories, such as utilitarianism, intuitionism, and rights theory. 

As such, 
different forms of policy reasoning correspond to the ethical theo- ries of utilitarianism, intuitionism, and rights theory. 

The analysis of policy reasoning thus recapitulates the philosophical understanding of three of the principal methods of ethics. 

this parallel suggests that disputes in public policy can be resolved by the adoption of the correct method of ethics. 

However 

 this makes the assumption that there is an identifiable correct method of ethics. 
Prac- tical public reasoning is not simply a matter of choosing a philosophical method and applying it mechanically 

It is a process of determining the inter-relationship between particular judgements on the one hand and patterns of normative reasoning on the other. 


# Evaluation and accountability

One of the central methods in normative analysis is the use of reflective equilibrium in the Rawlsian mode 

Reflective equilibrium tests ethical theories by the extent to which their application yields conclusions consistent with 'our considered judgments'.
For example, if a purported theory of justice carried the implication that under certain conditions slavery would be justified, then that theory would be deficient by the test of reflective equilibrium.
Similarly, when we understand particular policy positions as implications of policy paradigms, we can test how much intellectual credibility can be given to that paradigm by seeing whether its practical implications are consistent with our considered judgements. 

For example, if a liberal paradigm stressing personal responsibility led to the conclusion that it was an acceptable public policy to allow individuals to starve if they had brought their misfortune on themselves, for many people that would be a decisive count against that paradigm. 

Some ethical theorists reject the method of reflective equilibrium, arguing that if we start with justifiable premises and reason soundly, then we should be willing to accept the implica- tions of our principles come what may. 

Yet, there are at least two problems with rejecting reflective equilibrium. 

Firstly, without reflective equilibrium, one cannot tell the difference between a strikingly counter-intuitive, but valid, implication of an ethical theory on the one hand and a reductio ad absurdum on the other. 

A reductio ad absurdum works by drawing out the untoward conclusions of a set of premises showing those premises to lead to absurd conclusions. 

Secondly, public policy recommendations have to meet a test of political legitimacy and general acceptability. 

If the members of a society know that they will not be able to allow their fellow citizens to starve even as a result of those citizens’ lack of personal responsibility, then a policy position that advocated such an outcome would simply lack practical relevance. 

However, as the examples of slavery or destitution show, the method of reflective equilib- rium presupposes that there is a general social consensus about matters of value or principle that can provide the touchstone by which implied judgements can be assessed. 

Yet in many cases there 
may not be the social consensus required for the method of reflective equilibrium to persuade. 

For instance, a 
policy of maximising total health gain can lead to a preference for treating a large number of people with a relatively minor condition as against treating a small number of people each of whom has a serious condition. 

The approach equates medical need with the ability to benefit from an intervention, although some think that those in greatest need should be given priority, even when their chance of gaining health is rela- tively low. 

In sum, 
when there is not underlying social agreement on a conception of jus- tice, policy disagreements cannot easily be resolved by an assessment of how far a paradigm is in reflective equilibrium with social and political principles. 

Evidently, practical 
public reasoning requires assumptions, including assumptions as to how best to reason in practical terms, but those assumptions are neither self-evident nor universally shared. 

The implication is that reasoning will take us only so far in making policy decisions. 

Yet even if 
practical public reasoning is inherently incomplete, there may be ways of reducing gaps in understanding between advocates of compet- ing policy principles in ways that contribute to the quality of public deliberation and decision. 

A useful idea to that end is that of accountability for reasonableness 

Accountability is the principle that those who exercise or seek to influence public policy should be able to explain and justify the positions that they take.
Many non-elected public bodies also 
regard themselves as accountable through their reporting requirements, their duty to consult on changes in policy, their obligation to appear before legislative committees, and so on. 

In these different forums they explain the principles upon which their decisions are based, point to the evidence that they believe justifies their policy choices, and provide an opportunity for scrutiny and criticism. 

To be accountable in these ways is not to secure consensus.
The principal element of accountability is to set out a chain of reasoning in such a way that the policy conclusions can be seen to follow from the premises of the reasoning. 

This allows someone who disagrees with the premises of such reasoning to understand the justification of the policy choice.

# Conclusions

Evaluating any piece of policy reasoning is a complex task requiring an understanding of relevant principles, and the different ways in which those principles may be defined, as well as an appreciation of the patterns of reasoning within which those principles feature. 

Because policy arguments are always normative, involving the first-person plural point of view, their structure 

resembles the structures of ethical argument that philosophers have identified, including utilitar- ian, intuitionist, and deontological forms of argument. 

But unlike 
the philosophical appraisal of ethical theories 

the evaluation of policy arguments is subject to the constraint that public decisions have to be made, not least because delaying a decision is itself a form of decision. 

Evaluating policy principles and policy arguments is a task that is never fully completed.
